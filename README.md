In 2007, I was a high school student enrolled in every computer class available. The school had a proxy which blocked the majority of online games websites, and I wanted to solve the problem by hosting games for my friends and I. This led me down the deep rabbit hole of programming, kicking off my passion for building.

What started as a few `.swf` files, eventually became a database of hundreds of games and a PHP website to host them all. This is Gumbee's Games.

The website and database are no longer hosted anywhere, but feel free to explore the source and maybe find a few gems to play in your browser.

(note: games may be removed because I don't have the original agreements for hosting most of them, although they were all hosted legally at the time)
